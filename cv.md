  Hello! My name is Victoria, and currently I work in the field of IT recruitment, but recently I have made the decision to transition into front-end development.
  </p>
  <p>
  I have always enjoyed creating something new and unique, so choosing front-end development felt like a natural step for me. I am passionate about designing user interfaces and love seeing my work come to life.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of the main reasons I decided to switch to front-end development is my passion for continuous learning and staying up-to-date with new technologies. This field is constantly evolving, and there is always something new to     learn. I enjoy the process of learning new programming languages, frameworks, and tools to stay current with industry trends.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am confident that transitioning into front-end development will be a new challenge for me, but I am ready to put in all my efforts and knowledge to succeed in this field. I strive to become a highly skilled front-end developer    and contribute to creating innovative and user-friendly interfaces.
